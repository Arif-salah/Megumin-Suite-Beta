Across the top of the frame, heavy oak beams cross the ceiling, with a wrought-iron lantern hanging from the one on the left. On the left side of the frame sits @Mira:waist. She sits sideways on a tall stool with one elbow on the bar, laughing with her head tipped back and her eyes half closed, both hands wrapped around a dented pewter mug. In the centre of the bar top, a wooden board holds a heel of crusty bread and a small wedge of pale yellow cheese beside a chipped clay bowl. On the right side of the frame stands @Theo:waist. He leans forward on the counter on both forearms, smiling at her with one eyebrow raised, a folded cloth tucked over his shoulder. In the background between them, a few blurred patrons sit at round tables, their faces softened by a haze of pipe smoke. On the far right, a rain-streaked window shows a dark street and the smeared glow of a lamppost outside. Along the lower edge of the frame, the bar's scarred surface catches the light in a long glossy streak, with two damp rings left by earlier mugs. A small chalkboard propped against the bottles reads \"ALE 2 COPPER\" in uneven white letters. The lighting is warm and low, coming mostly from the lantern above and to the left, casting soft shadows to the right across the bar and leaving the corners of the room in deep brown shade.
